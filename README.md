# Campervan Dashboard

A Dashboard to monitor and control the electrics in the campervan - see [Campervan](https://github.com/akladnig/CamperVan) for details of the campervan physical design using [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/) and the electrical design. 

The control board for the campervan is based on an Arduino Nano ESP32. Communication between the devices is based on Websockets.

This project has only just started so it is a shell only.
